## Dedication

I have been asked to forward this message:

> My deepest gratitude goes to Miniplenty for proving this barely used set of card. This has been made possible because our standard of living has risen by no less than 20% over the last year.
>
> Soiltaire serves as a reminder of the pointlessness of individuality and that only the full submission to the party serves as an escape and makes one all-powerful and immortal. Alone the human is always defeated. It must be so because every human is doomed to die.
>
> **Big Brother provides our new, happy life**

## Disclaimer

This game is no political statement. I used this theme because I am a big fan of the book 1984 and the world building.
