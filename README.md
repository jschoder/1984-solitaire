# Personal Playground

This software isn't intended for serious use. I am playing around with different things I find interesting. The process is hacky and I don't test even close to enough.

** DISCLAIMER: ** This is no political statement. I used this theme because I am a big fan of the book 1984 and the world building. And while we are at it: The best evidence that we are not living in the world of 1984 is that the book 1984 exists and hasn't been erased from history.

**DON'T TRY THIS AT WORK**

I also don't claim any copyright over the assets or code.
